# MagicSquare
My project is a Java programming endeavor comprising two mini-projects. The first mini-project, named 'g5_13,' consists of several files implementing various search strategies. The second mini-project, 'g5_13_2C,' involves different implementations of a program aimed at solving the magic square problem using search strategies and heuristics.
